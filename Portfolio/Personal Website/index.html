      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Technical things like Graphic design and coding come fairly easily to me always have, fascinated by anything complex and easily ensnared by the challenging.
        I have recently come to enjoy excercise through sports like Climbing, Swimming, and Wrestling. Still I wouldn't be me without my best friends and fellow programmers;
        Avery, Bonham, and Kris. Having the support of friends in a journey as complex as learning programming is invaluable.

      </p>
      <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>
          I've lived in Arizona for as long as I can remember though I was born in Nebraska. My life growing up was spent behind a computer screen hiding from the Arizona heat,
          mastering strategy games like civilization, and building redstone machines in minecraft. In High school I very quickly found a passion for graphic design and have been
          working in photoshop since 2009. Since then i've expanded to photography, as well as penning vector art in Illustrator.
        </p>
      <h2>Why I decided to learn Programming</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been a technical person so being able to learn a skill that pays well, has an incredibly low unemployment rate, and evolves at a rate that will keep me interested was kind of a no brainer.
          As  well it is a natural evolution of my graphic design skills to a more interactive and profitable platform. If I am to acomplish my goals and be of any help to this world I need to acquire Wealth, Power, and Prestige.
          After reviewing the current trends the shortest and most logical path to those goals was by learning to program, so here I am ready to start my programming journey, overjoyed at the prospects it brings.
